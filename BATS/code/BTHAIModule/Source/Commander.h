/** The Commander class is the heart of deciding high level strategies like when and where to engage the enemy.
 * It is responsible for deciding when to attack the enemy, where to attack him, and when a retreat 
 * is the best option to do.
 * All units are grouped into Squads, and the Commander directs the different Squads to attack
 * or defend positions. Each Squad are in turn responsible for handle the task it has been assigned.
 *
 * The Commander is implemented as a singleton class. Each class that needs to access Commander can request an instance,
 * and all classes shares the same Commander instance.
