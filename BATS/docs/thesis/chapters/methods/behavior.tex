\section{Behavior}
In their article\cite{abraham10} Abraham and McGee mentions four teammate models.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Master-slave model:} The player commands the teammate bot fully, and the bot has little or no artificial behavior.
	\item \textbf{Semi-autonomous slave model:} The player commands the teammate bot when s/he desires. When no command is active the bots behave autonomously. Although bots can behave autonomously they will still always act as a slave.
	\item \textbf{Clone model:} This requires that all teammate have equal abilities and roles; the main reason is to complete the goal faster, i.e. the more teammates the faster it goes. E.g. almost like fetching water 100 buckets of water from a distant well, you can manage it yourself but it goes faster with more people.
	\item \textbf{“Buddy” model:} Both player and bot has comparable weaknesses and the bot does not act just as the player’s slave.
\end{itemize}
We would like to add another one, semi-autonomous model, which is how our bot works.
