\section{Defense manager}
\label{sec:defense_manager}
The Defense manager handles the defense of its own base and the player’s base. It calculates defense
locations from BATS's and the teammate's outer choke points (marked \usebox{\LegendDotRed} and
\usebox{\LegendDotOrange} in figure \ref{fig:defense_locations}. It does not defend a region that
only abuts to BATS or teammate occupied regions \usebox{\LegendLineYellow}.

The \nameref{sec:patrol_squad} patrols between the \usebox{\LegendDotRed} locations.
\nameref{sec:hold_squad}s guards these locations but are stationed in the roaming circle
\usebox{\LegendCircleViolet} where the center is calculated by finding a position in the range
\squadDefendRoamDistanceMinMax~closest to one of BATS’s or the teammate’s buildings and the radius
being \squadDefendRoamPerimeter. Units from the Hold squad will stay in the roaming perimeter until
enemy units enter the defense perimeter (\squadDefendDefendPerimeter~in radius), they will then
start to attack the enemy.

Hold squads only contains unit good at defending choke points, whereas Patrol squads contains all
free units and patrol between the defense locations. If enemy units enter the enemy offensive
perimeter (\squadDefendEnemyOffensivePerimeter~in radius) in a defense location all squad units will
move to the defend location to defend it, all other hold squads will disband to join the defense
with the Patrol squad. The idea was first to only disband the other Hold squads if the enemy is too
strong, but the calculation proved to be more time consuming than guessed, thus we focused work on
other more important areas. The strategy was tested and works good against one StarCraft default
bot, as it only attacks from one location at a time.  Two default bots can however attack from
different locations, but usually attacked from one location. Two bots were, however, often too
strong for BATS to defend by itself. Although the strategy worked against the default bot it would
probably not work against other bots or humans that can attack two different locations
simultaneously.

Both Hold squads and Patrol squads roam or patrol between BATS’s defense location, meaning the bot
will not disturb the teammate with its units.

\paragraph{Defending other locations}
Although no Hold squads are located on and the Patrol squad never patrols between the teammates
defend locations. It will still send the Patrol squad to defend a teammate defend locations if BATS
is not under attack itself. In addition to defending all defend locations, the Defense manager will
send out the Patrol squad to defend locations either inside BATS’s or the teammate's base that are
under attack, for example if the enemy drops inside the base. This will, however, never bring the
Hold squads as they should defend the entrance to the base.
