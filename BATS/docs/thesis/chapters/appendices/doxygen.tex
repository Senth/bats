\chapter{Doxygen documentetanion}
\label{sec:doxygen}
Since the doxygen documentation would be several hundreds of pages and be hard to search for, we refer to the online documentation found at: \url{http://bats.senth.org/doxygen/}. If the page is down and you want the documentation, please send an email to \href{mailto:matteus.magnusson@gmail.com}{matteus.magnusson@gmail.com} and he will send you a new working link.
