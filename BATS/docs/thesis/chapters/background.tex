\chapter{Background}
While RTS games has been along since the 80s\cite{adams06, rtsHistory}, only a handful of scientific articles can be found on teammate bots for RTS games, and current big RTS titles have yet to implement a good teammate bot. In general little research has been done for teammate bots throughout all genres; RTS researchers instead seem to focus, or at least have focused, on enemy bots to either create a fun opponent

or to create the best bot to compete in RTS bot tournaments, such as  AIIDE's StarCraft AI Competinion\cite{scaiide} and CIG's StarCraft AI Competition\cite{sccig}.

First related research topics will be covered, beginning with teammate bots across all genres and asking what guidelines can apply to RTS games; continuing with RTS enemy bots and asking, what implementation strategies exists, how shall a good bot play; and ending with communication between AI and humans to minimize misinterpretation by the player, this includes design choices. After plowing through all research you will be updated with the current games using teammate bots and what has been used in other genres that RTS is lacking.

What has been done instead is a lot of research about enemy bots for RTS games. 




\section{Implementation in games}


Today, no RTS games, that we know of, allows communication with a teammate bot; players can, however, play with a bot, but instead of trying to collaborate with player it acts more or less (depending on the game) on its own, it can try to complement the player's behavior but does not ask if this is the preferred choice for the player.
