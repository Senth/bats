\chapter{Introduction}
Have you ever wanted to be the boos over your teammate bot\footnote{A bot is a computer player that you either can play with or against} in a game? No!? Then you can stop reading. Today you can find a few new Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games, but none of these lets you control your teammate bot, let alone collaborate with it, at least not to our knowledge; this includes research, where we have not found a single subject on communication between human player and bot.

The focus lies in evaluating if it is worthwhile to do further research in this unexplored area, both for the purpose of researchers and for game developers to help them decide if they shall invest money in a collaborative teammate bot for RTS games.

To familiarize you with the subjects presented a brief description on all subjects are given below. Once you have basic knowledge of the subjects we will give a thorough background what others have done in closely related subjects. Next a detailed description of the methods we used are described; this includes implementation on the bot, why it was implement this way, and how it was evaluated.

The evaluation results are then presented, at the end we conclude the results and presents new subjects of future work.

\section{RTS}
An RTS game is a computer game that heavily relies on strategy and fast executing. An analogy would be to play chess where both you and your opponent can move pieces at the same time, you will only see your own pieces and a tile beside them; meaning you do not know the location of the opponent’s pieces or when s/he makes a move, on top of that you have to think of a strategy fast before your opponent gets a lead.

In reality, RTS games resembles more a battle field than a game of chess—you control the army and it’s unit and on what the resources shall be spent on. From the start of the game you have a single base and your goal is to build up the technology to create powerful units by collecting resources, but you cannot go straight for the best technology because it takes time and if the opponent comes with any attack you will be defenseless against it.

There is no real standard how RTS games they all work a bit different but have the

and a set of workers, these workers can build buildings and collect resources—used to build buildings, upgrades, and units. Various versions of how you collect and build buildings exists, some games does not use workers for building buildings, and some gets resources from buildings placed at specific points.
