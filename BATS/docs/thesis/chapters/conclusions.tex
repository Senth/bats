\chapter{Conclusions}
We conclude that a teammate bot for RTS games that communicates its intentions and reasons is indeed more fun to play with, just as according to our hypothesis. What surprised us was that some players prefered when the bot only communicated and could not be controlled. This was later identified to depend on the player's skill where more experienced players liked control more and beginners tended to get overwhelmed by all the existing game action and thus did not want to focus on yet another task: controlling the bot.
