\chapter{Problem description and problem statement}
As has been stated, we have yet to find any work on communication with teammate bots for RTS games, to this point. The problem, or rather our hypothesis, is that we think a teammate bot that conveys its intentions, asks for guidance, and be somewhat controlled by the player (through messages) to execute various tactics will give more diversity to the game, opening up for new game experiences.

\section{Aims and Objectives?}

\section{Research Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Is a communicating and controllable bot more fun to play with than just a controllable bot?
\item Test
\end{enumerate}
