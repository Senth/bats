	This thesis evaluates if a teammate bot, in Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games, can be used as a tool to
create new experiences. The bot extends an existing bot in StarCraft: Brood War; the bot
functions more or less as a human player, but the player gives it high-level commands about tactics and
strategies. To test the bot, it comes with three degrees of initiative: low, medium, and high; the player is asked to
play with all. When the bot is implemented players evaluate the bot by playing with it and then interviewed about their
opinions on the bot.
